## Overview

Take a list of dates and numbers held within a Javascript array of arrays
eg: let finances = [
    ['Jan-2010', 867884],
    ['Feb-2010', 984655], etc etc
and code the following results to show both in the console and in the web browser:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

These results are to be generated by Javacript created by the user (me) and not simply typed.

The results should allow any addition or subtraction to the original list of dates (string) and amount (numbers), and automatically update results.

The files you are now seeing do just that.

Results are also (and do) demonstarte the use of concatenation in results.

## My process

### Built with

- JS - Use Javascript variables, maths and conditions, to hold, change and calculate a series of business data results based on original information provided
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- In file CSS styling
<br><br>
### What I learned

From a simple list of dates (strings) and profits (numbers), Javascript is an amazing language to calculate and display certain properties. 
<br><br>
In this example we could show various statistics including:
<br><br>
Total length of time stats taken - using .length
<br><br>
The total amount of profit using a for-loop and calcualtion.
<br><br>
The difference between each month in terms of profit and loss - using .map
<br><br>
The profit and loss for each month using math.
<br><br>
And so much more (see results in browser or the console log for full results achieved.)
